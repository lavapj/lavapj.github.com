			<h2>From My Blog</h2>

			<div class="sixteen columns" >

					<h3>Coast Guard App</h3>

					<p>Yay!! Week of week 2 and I made my first app in Ruby! Granted the client (and only faithful user) is my hubby and I’m bartering for household chores, but ya gotta start somewhere, right? :)<br /><br />My husband is joining the Coast Guard Reserve and is required to memorize a ton of stuff including the USCG ranks, insignia, and corresponding information. There’s an existing app that’s pretty good but for his studying purposes it had one major shortcoming – the rank information was listed in the same order every time. He wanted more of a flashcard style app that displays in random order. [Enter wife to the rescue!!]<br /><br />What a great feeling to get to show off some of my newfound coding skills and solve a problem for the guy I love. The app is super simple, and there’s probably a much more efficient way to do it, but it ended up being the perfect project to synthesize a lot of the info we learned in week 2 (i.e. Middleman, Ruby hashes and arrays, erb templates, etc.). I also got some practice with Github and Heroku and it seems that you can’t practice that enough.</p>
